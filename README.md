# Port of tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster themes for Helix editor

![greatness.](https://github.com/qrvaldemar/helix-theme-alabaster/blob/main/would-you-look-at-this.png)

there is yet only half-assed dark theme. but things will get better (I also want to port a light bg variant and make dark variant less ass), i promise (you better stop believing people that promise you things and contribute. I would like to read even a simple blurry suggestion issue (especially if you are somewhat proficient in helix and think that theme is missing something.)

it's half-assed because i really just downloaded a helix theme template and did some basic configuring. and because i decided to use GNOME pallete (colors are still the same, just *not exactly*). and because I really didn't use Helix before and not sure what is what.
