right now there is only a half-assed dark theme and very rough draft of a white theme. but things will get better (I also want to port a light bg variant and make dark variant less ass), I promise (you better stop believing people that promise you things and contribute. I would like to read even a simple blurry suggestion (especially if you are somewhat proficient in helix.)

it's half-assed because i really just downloaded a helix theme template and did some basic configuring. and also because I decided to use GNOME pallete (colors are still the same, just *not exactly*.) and also because I really haven't yet used Helix much and not sure what is what.

## Installation
### Linux
Just download `/themes` folder and put `.toml` files in `~/.config/helix/themes/` (if those directory's do not exist to just create them)

for easier updates `git clone` this repository, copy needed theme or themes to `~/.config/helix/themes/` and `git pull` later as it updates (:J)
